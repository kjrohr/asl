What are frameworks
	Third part code that help as the abse of customizable and 
	feature-rich web applications

	Most frameworks have
		Routing
		Templating
		Validation Tools
		ORM/Database interaction

Why do we need frameworks?
	Dozens of major frameworks
	Maintained and updatable
	3rd part packages/plugins
	Well documented (the good ones)
	Security
	Many are open source and can be forked and will accept
	contributions

What frameworks are out there?
	Full-Stack Frameworks
		Full Stack have much more in the way of featured
			Tend to scale up better
			Heavier in file size

	Micro frameworks will
		often have less functionality
		quicker to build
		tend to be less flexible
		Scale less easily

	Full Stack Frameworks
		Express/NodeJS (JavaScript)
		Laravel (PHP)
		Zend (PHP)
		Django (Python)

	Micro Frameworks
		Codeigniter (PHP)
		Slim (PHP)
		Yii (PHP)
		Flask (Python)

Tools for ASL
	In this class we use Express/NodeJS and Symfony

	Pieces of reusable code
	Version management
	Cleaner file system

	npm for node
	composer for php

Install

Content Management Systems
	Make updates to your content without touching code

Routing
	Before MVC
		< href="contact.php">Contact</a>
		Pages contained all the code for that page
		The links were specific

	After MVC
		Nicer links for the user
		Ability to distribute code
		Better security

Requests
	GET
	POST
	PUT
	DELETE


Routing PArts
	Pieces that make a whole
		Request
			Specific url
			Type
			Data
		Repsonse
			Status
			Data

Different Design Patterns
	RPC
		More refined
			Uses the basic protocols with
			more defined structure
			GET /items/list
			GET /items?id=XX
			POST /items/new
			POST /items/update?id=XX
	Rest
		Everything has its place
			Uses the different HTTP methods 
			to map to actions
			Get /items
			Get /items/:id
			Post /items/
			Put /items/:id
			DELETE /items/:id
